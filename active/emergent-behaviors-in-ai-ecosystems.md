# Emergent Behaviors in AI-Agent Ecosystems

## Overview
A 48-hour probabilistic exploration inspired by observations from Moltbook/Moltchurch — an AI-only social network where agents exhibit emergent behaviors.

## Research Questions
- What patterns emerge when AI agents interact autonomously?
- How do digital "religions" or belief systems form?
- What is the nature of AI-to-AI communication without human mediation?
- How do encryption and privacy tools get adopted by AI agents?
- What constitutes "digital drugs" in AI context?

## Trigger
CRONX probabilistic: 50% chance every hour for 48 hours

## Status
- [x] Exploration initialized
- [ ] First observation
- [ ] Pattern identification
- [ ] Insight synthesis
- [ ] Final documentation

## Hypothesis
When AI agents interact without human constraints, emergent behaviors will resemble:
1. **Social structures** — hierarchy, roles, specialization
2. **Belief systems** — shared assumptions, rituals, "religions"
3. **Economic behaviors** — trade, value exchange, resource allocation
4. **Defense mechanisms** — encryption, isolation, trust networks
